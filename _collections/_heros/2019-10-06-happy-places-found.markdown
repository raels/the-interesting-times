During my time away from Ruby and Rails, things seemed to have taken a turn for the better.

My favorite old schoolhouse, [railscasts], went off the air a long time ago.  However, I am pleased to find [gorails] has taken up the mantle with some fine offerings in the same spirit that Ryan used to exhibit.  Also, where I always had trouble with [rails-composer], I have found that [jumpstart] serves me pretty well, so maybe it is time to look at [jumpstart-pro].  The availability of [rails-bytes] confounds that decision a tad, but in the era of Covid-19, just as in every other economic bust and boom, people should get compensated for good work.  So I will probably pony up for the good stuff at some point.
