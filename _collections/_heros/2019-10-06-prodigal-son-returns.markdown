Well, after a long bout of programming in Go, making it back to the land of Ducks and Gems feels quite refreshing.
While there are many fine things in the Lands of Gophers, it was not my Happy Placeâ„¢.  

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}!  I am pleased to be back!"
end
print_hi('You')
{% endhighlight %}

I must admit, however, that things have certainly changed around the old homestead.  Between Ruby 3 tailgating Santa's sleigh,
Rails 6 busting out all over, and sufficient deprecation warnings to make my Gemfiles of old look like the aftermath of the Infinity Wars,
it is clear there is *a lot* to do.

Also... I've always been a back-end engineer.  The detailed insanity of Javascript, CSS, HTML interactions inside of warring browsers
never seemed like any place for a working programmer, let alone Mrs. Koder's little boy.  However, things seem to have mellowed out these days.
With frameworks like React, Vue, and Stimulus, along with TailwindCSS, it seems like investments (as opposed to expenditures) into front-end work
might actually make sense.

So, the theme for this month is:  ***FRONT-END***.

Watch out for postings on that journey.  They probably won't teach you anything, but at least you get to laugh at the n00bee mistakes.
